Night-time asthma was assessed according to the following scale on the eDiary: 0=no symptoms during the night; 1=symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early); 2=symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early); 3=symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night; 4=symptoms so severe I did not sleep at all.
